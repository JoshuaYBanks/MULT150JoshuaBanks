So I learned that I want another pair of arms and hands because coding takes way too long (and my back is itchy). 

1. Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
        A: At this point I think the game is too easy.  My first reason is that the obstacles are too high.  When I made the obstacles I was confused because they were pretty high off of the ground.  I have checked around 3-4 times to see if I misread the textbook, but from what it says I think I did everything right. Right now the obstacles are so high that they can't even touch the player. The position is too high currently, I plan to modify it.  The second reason is that the power ups are too easy to collect.  (I had trigger off of the powers for a while so I thought they didn't do anything) This has to do with the obstacles being obsolete, but basically the game fails to pose much challenge with getting power ups and keeping the time up.  If there was less power ups it would help increase the difficulty, or if I get the obstacles working that to will increase the difficulty.

2. What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
        A: Two changes I would do is lower the obstacles so they are an actual threat to the player, and I will decrease the size of the power to make it harder to get to.  Moving the obstacles down ensures that there is actually a challenge in the game, so there can actually be a reason to play. Decreasing the size of powerups only increase the challenge, which would make it harder. 

3. List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
        A: I could increase the light from the powerups, since a more appealing powerup provides a nicer look to the game overall.  I could also create a red light from the side walls to give a greater look of laser walls, which would make the background far more appealing.
4. What 2 parts of the game are fun? 
        A: The movement and the ground and wall materials are very fun for me, the movement is very interesting and a bit challenging, but overall give a better game feel which made it fun.  The materials from the chapter files also are really nice materials, I may try to use them again later. 

5. What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
        A:  Collecting power ups and the time limit going down is a bit tedious.  At a certain point the player is just doing the same motions again and again endlessly, not allowing for any real experience.  There isn't a end goal at all, so at a certain point the whole game becomes tedious.


For the changes I made: I turned the obstacle into a cylinder, and made the red light very powerful, so now it looks sort of interesting, and at some point the obstacle also became a powerup.  The actual powerup's particle system was modified to have a 0.2 speed scale and a 0.9 min. particle size.
