/* I did a lot of random modifications before I realized I had to write them down, and I forgot a kit of modifications that I did, so I'll just say the ones I remember:     I changed the start color, simulation space(I think), changed the max particles, changed the culling mode, gave it color ver lifetime, size over lifetime, a texture sheet (a sprite was added) I added lights, added trails, and changed the particle size in the renderer */
